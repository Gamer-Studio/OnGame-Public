  - Yeah... it's your turn now.
  - I used to walk that dungeon more times than I can count.
  - Some doors open when you're ready. Others... when you're brave enough.
  - I left a few things behind in there. If you find them... they're yours now. You'll
    need them more than I do.
  - Good luck. And hey - watch your step, unlike I did.
